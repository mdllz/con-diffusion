  abstract = {The psychological study of creativity is essential to human progress. If strides are to be made in the sciences, humanities, and arts, we must arrive at a far more detailed understanding of the creative process, its antecedents, and its inhibitors. This review, encompassing most subspecialties in the study of creativity and focusing on twenty-first-century literature, reveals both a growing interest in creativity among psychologists and a growing fragmentation in the field. To be sure, research into the psychology of creativity has grown theoretically and methodologically sophisticated, and researchers have made important contributions from an ever-expanding variety of disciplines. But this expansion has not come without a price. Investigators in one subfield often seem unaware of advances in another. Deeper understanding requires more interdisciplinary research, based on a systems view of creativity that recognizes a variety of interrelated forces operating at multiple levels.},

  abstract = {Training of divergent thinking, which is commonly regarded as an important component underlying creativity, often involves the administration of a large number of moderated sessions. This exploratory study examines a computer-based divergent thinking training program with respect to its effectiveness in enhancing ideational fluency and originality on the basis of practice. Two training versions were developed: (a) a training of verbal creativity and (b) a training of functional creativity. Both training versions consisted of 9 sessions with 8 divergent thinking tasks each. Two training groups (consisting of 11 participants each) and a control group (n = 14) were matched for creativity, intelligence, age, and gender; the groups were tested in a pre–posttest design. The computer training was found to effectively enhance the intelligent–independent aspect of ideational fluency (d = 0.54), whereas no training effects with respect to the originality of ideas were observed. The findings point to the usefulness of a computer-based training to enhance creativity-relevant abilities.},

  abstract = {Divergent thinking (DT) ability (i.e., the ability to come up with creative ideas) is a complex cognitive construct that has been associated with several specific components of the Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model. In this study, we employed a nested latent variable approach to examine the specific role of mental speed (Gs) and general retrieval ability (Gr) in DT ability, which was assessed by DT tasks that instructed to be creative and were scored for creative quality. Specifically, Gs was assumed to facilitate both Gr and DT, and Gr was assumed to contribute to DT. Successive latent variable models with orthogonal factors were tested to reflect these nested cognitive basic abilities. The proposed model of nested factors fit the data well: Latent Gs accounted for variation in Gs, Gr, and DT creative quality scores, latent Gr predicted performance in Gr and DT scores beyond Gs, and latent DT explained variation in DT scores beyond Gs and Gr. In addition, we related the resulting orthogonal latent variables to the external criteria of school grades to illustrate the explanatory power of the modeling approach. This study provides evidence that divergent thinking performance relies on mental speed and retrieval ability, as well as cognitive abilities unique to divergent thinking. We discuss consequences for the understanding of divergent thinking ability in the context of the CHC model.},

The relationship between regulatory focus and creativity has also been investigated, with similar results. However, the focus of these efforts has been on the idea generation phase. This study suggests that the influence of regulatory focus on creativity operates differently for the idea evaluation phase than with the idea generation phase. Furthermore, there are differential effects of promotion and prevention focus depending on the aspect of the idea that is being evaluated.},

  abstract = {It is a central assumption in creativity theory that the creativity of an idea is defined by its novelty and usefulness. The present study examined this notion by investigating how the perceived novelty and usefulness actually contribute to the overall evaluation of creativity. We collected responses to a verbal and a figural divergent thinking task in a sample of 1,500 participants. All ideas were evaluated for novelty, usefulness, or creativity by a total of 18 independent judges. Results generally indicate a greater importance of novelty than usefulness in the prediction of creativity scores. Novelty and usefulness interacted significantly in the prediction of creativity both as a linear and as a nonlinear term. An examination of the interaction between novelty and usefulness suggests that usefulness is predictive of creativity only within highly novel ideas. In conclusion, novelty can be regarded as a first-order criterion and usefulness as a second-order criterion of creativity: If an idea is not novel its usefulness does not matter much, but if an idea is novel its usefulness will additionally determine its actual creativity.},

To explain this paradox, we propose that people can hold a bias against creativity that is not necessarily overt and that is activated when people experience a motivation to reduce uncertainty. In two experiments, we manipulated uncertainty using different methods, including an uncertaintyreduction prime. The results of both experiments demonstrated the existence of a negative bias against creativity (relative to practicality) when participants experienced uncertainty. Furthermore, this bias against creativity interfered with participants’ ability to recognize a creative idea. These results reveal a concealed barrier that creative actors may face as they attempt to gain acceptance for their novel ideas.},

  abstract = {Model comparison in Bayesian mixed models is becoming popular in psychological science. Here we develop a set of nested models that account for order restrictions across individuals in psychological tasks. An order-restricted model addresses the question “Does everybody,” as in “Does everybody show the usual Stroop effect,” or “Does everybody respond more quickly to intense noises than subtle ones?” The crux of the modeling is the instantiation of 10s or 100s of order restrictions simultaneously, one for each participant. To our knowledge, the problem is intractable in frequentist contexts but relatively straightforward in Bayesian ones. We develop a Bayes factor model-comparison strategy using Zellner and Siow’s default g-priors appropriate for assessing whether effects obey equality and order restrictions. We apply the methodology to seven data sets from Stroop, Simon, and Eriksen interference tasks. Not too surprisingly, we find that everybody Stroops—that is, for all people congruent colors are truly named more quickly than incongruent ones. But, perhaps surprisingly, we find these order constraints are violated for some people in the Simon task, that is, for these people spatially incongruent responses occur truly more quickly than congruent ones! Implications of the modeling and conjectures about the task-related differences are discussed.},

  abstract = {A prevailing notion in experimental psychology is that individuals’ performance in a task varies gradually in a continuous fashion. In a Stroop task, for example, the true average effect may be 50 ms with a standard deviation of say 30 ms. In this case, some individuals will have greater effects than 50 ms, some will have smaller, and some are forecasted to have negative effects in sign—they respond faster to incongruent items than to congruent ones! But are there people who have a true negative effect in Stroop or any other task? We highlight three qualitatively different effects: negative effects, null effects, and positive effects. The main goal of this paper is to develop models that allow researchers to explore whether all three are present in a task: Do all individuals show a positive effect? Are there individuals with truly no effect? Are there any individuals with negative effects? We develop a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that capture a variety of these constraints. We apply this approach to Stroop interference experiments and a near-liminal priming experiment where the prime may be below and above threshold for different people. We show that most tasks people are quite alike—for example everyone has positive Stroop effects and nobody fails to Stroop or Stroops negatively. We also show a case that under very specific circumstances, we could entice some people to not Stroop at all.},

Experiment 1 showed that error responses speed up relative to correct responses under instructions to respond quickly. Experiment 2 showed that that responses to less probable stimuli are slower and less accurate than responses to more probable stimuli. The data from both experiments support the diffusion model for lexical decision (Ratcliff, Gomez, \& McKoon, 2004). At the same time, the data provide evidence against the popular deadline model for lexical decision. The deadline model assumes that “nonword” responses are given only after the “word” response has timed out – consequently, the deadline model cannot account for the data from experimental conditions in which “nonword” responses are systematically faster than “word” responses.},

We used the typical Wiener diffusion model with four parameters: boundary separation, non-decision time, initial bias and drift rate parameter. Beyond the distribution functions, we provide extended likelihood-based functions that can be used for parameter estimation and model selection. The package can be obtained via CRAN.},

However, the practical application of these models is notoriously complicated, and flexible methods are largely nonexistent. We combine a popular model for choice response times—the Wiener diffusion process—with techniques from psychometrics in order to construct a hierarchical diffusion model. Chief among these techniques is the application of random effects, with which we allow for unexplained variability among participants, items, or other experimental units. These techniques lead to a modeling framework that is highly flexible and easy to work with. Among the many novel models this statistical framework provides are a multilevel diffusion model, regression diffusion models, and a large family of explanatory diffusion models. We provide examples and the necessary computer code.},

To introduce this special issue, we discuss four of the most important potential hierarchical Bayesian contributions. The first involves the development of more complete theories, including accounting for variation coming from sources like individual differences in cognition. The second involves the capability to account for observed behavior in terms of the combination of multiple different cognitive processes. The third involves using a few key psychological variables to explain behavior on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The fourth involves the conceptual unification and integration of disparate cognitive models. For all of these potential contributions, we outline an appropriate general hierarchical Bayesian modeling structure. We also highlight current models that already use the hierarchical Bayesian approach, as well as identifying research areas that could benefit from its adoption. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a randomeffects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

After critically reviewing past scoring methods, this article describes a new approach to assessing divergent thinking and appraises its reliability and validity. In our new Top 2 scoring method, participants complete a divergent thinking task and then circle the 2 responses that they think are their most creative responses. Raters then evaluate the responses on a 5-point scale. Regarding reliability, a generalizability analysis showed that subjective ratings of unusual-uses tasks and instances tasks yield dependable scores with only 2 or 3 raters. Regarding validity, a latent-variable study (n ϭ 226) predicted divergent thinking from the Big Five factors and their higher-order traits (Plasticity and Stability). Over half of the variance in divergent thinking could be explained by dimensions of personality. The article presents instructions for measuring divergent thinking with the new method.},

  abstract = {I argue that any attempt to define creative ideas cannot fully succeed without also defining uncreative ideas. This argument begins by defining three parameters that characterize a potentially creative thought: the idea’s initial probability (p), the final utility (u), and the creator’s prior knowledge of that utility (v). The three parameters then lead to a three-criterion multiplicative definition of personal creativity, namely, c = (1 À p)u(1 À v), where the first factor indicates originality and the third factor surprise. Although creativity can only maximize as originality, utility, and surprise all approach unity, the same definition indicates that there are seven different ways that creativity can minimize. These alternatives were identified as (a) routine, reproductive, or habitual ideas, (b) fortuitous response bias, (c) irrational perseveration, (d) problem finding, (e) rational suppression, (f) irrational suppression, and (g) blissful ignorance. If the third parameter v is omitted, then the number of creative and noncreative outcomes reduces to just four, making creativity indistinguishable from irrational suppression. The alternative outcomes are then illustrated using the classic two-string problem. Besides providing a more finely differentiated conception of creativity failures, the definition has critical implications regarding the processes and procedures required to generate highly creative ideas.},

This enables easy and straightforward estimation of the Bayes factor and its Monte Carlo Error. In this set-up, the issue of sensitivity to model specific prior distributions reduces to sensitivity to one prior distribution, that is, the prior for the encompassing model. It is shown that for specific classes of inequality constrained models, the Bayes factors for the constrained with the unconstrained model is virtually independent of the encompassing prior, that is, model selection is virtually objective.},

Psychologists usually use correlations to measure the degree of linear relationship between 2 sets of scores, ignoring differences in means and standard deviations. In medicine, biology, chemistry, and physics, a more stringent criterion is often used: the extent to which scores are identically equal. For each test taker (or other unit of measurement), the difference between the 2 scores is calculated. The root mean square difference (RMSD) represents the average change from 1 set of scores to the other, and the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) rescales this coefficient to have a maximum value of 1. This article shows the relationship of the RMSD and CCC to the intraclass correlation coefficients, product–moment correlation, and standard error of measurement. Finally, this article adapts the RMSD and the CCC for linear, consistency, and absolute definitions of agreement.},

  abstract = {How well can people judge the creativity of their ideas? The distinction between generating ideas and evaluating ideas appears in many theories of creativity, but the massive literature on generation has overshadowed the question of evaluation. After critically reviewing the notion of accuracy in creativity judgments, this article explores whether (1) people in general are discerning and (2) whether some people are more discerning than others. University students (n ϭ 226) completed four divergent thinking tasks and then decided which responses were their most creative. Judges then rated the creativity of all of the responses. Multilevel latent-variable models found that people’s choices strongly agreed with judges’ ratings of the responses; overall, people were discerning in their decisions. But some people were more discerning than others: people high in openness to experience, in particular, had stronger agreement between their decisions and the judges’ ratings. Creative people are thus doubly skilled: they are better at generating good ideas and at picking their best ideas.},

  abstract = {In the present investigation, we make the claim that the creative process of generating, evaluating, and selecting ideas has cognitive and metacognitive components, capable of influencing each other. Hence, we suggest broadening the scope of creative metacognition. We take an exploratory approach to test relationships between creative beliefs and metacognitive indicators in three studies with business students. Across three studies, overestimation of the quality of one´s ideas and originality scores had a negative relationship with accurate idea selection. Creative self-efficacy, growth mindsets, and ease of idea generation were positively related to the overestimation of the creativity of ideas generated. In addition, creative self-efficacy and growth mindsets had a positive relationship with originality scores. We also found some results that were interesting, but inconsistent across all three studies. Ease of idea generation, for example, had a positive relationship with accurate idea selection but a non-significant relationship in the remaining two studies. Similarly, originality scores significantly informed ease of idea generation in one of three studies. The applied and theoretical implications for creative metacognition were discussed.},

In this article we describe the development of a novel test for the assessment of creativity evaluation skills, which was designed to be part of an admission test for teacher education. The final test presents 72 ideas that have to be judged as being common, inappropriate, or creative. Two studies examined the psychometric quality of the test, and explored relationships of creativity evaluation skills with cognitive ability and personality. In the first study, we observed that creativity evaluation skills are positively correlated with divergent thinking creativity and creative achievement, which suggests that evaluation skills are relevant for creative ideation as well as creative accomplishment. Across both studies, people tended to underestimate the creativity of ideas. Openness, intelligence and language competence predicted higher creativity evaluation skills, and this effect was partly mediated by a less negative evaluation bias. These findings contribute to our understanding of why people sometimes fail to recognize the creativity in others.},

A natural hypothesis is that the brain carries out the computations associated with the value comparisons in a manner consistent with the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), since this model has been able to account for a large amount of data in other domains. We investigated the ability of four different versions of the DDM to explain the data in a real binary food choice task under conditions of high and low time pressure. We found that a seven-parameter version of the DDM can account for the choice and reaction time data with high-accuracy, in both the high and low time pressure conditions. The changes associated with the introduction of time pressure could be traced to changes in two key model parameters: the barrier height and the noise in the slope of the drift process.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose two interpretations for the discrimination parameter in the two-parameter logistic model (2PLM). The interpretations are based on the relation between the 2PLM and two stochastic models. In the first interpretation, the 2PLM is linked to a diffusion model so that the probability of absorption equals the 2PLM. The discrimination parameter is the distance between the two absorbing boundaries and therefore the amount of information that has to be collected before a response to an item can be given. For the second interpretation, the 2PLM is connected to a specific type of race model. In the race model, the discrimination parameter is inversely related to the dependency of the information used in the decision process. Extended versions of both models with person-to-person variability in the difficulty parameter are considered. When fitted to a data set, it is shown that a generalization of the race model that allows for dependency between choices and response times (RTs) is the best-fitting model.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes latent variable models from a cognitive psychology perspective. We start by discussing work by Tuerlinckx and De Boeck (2005), who proved that a diffusion model for 2-choice response processes entails a 2-parameter logistic item response theory (IRT) model for individual differences in the response data. Following this line of reasoning, we discuss the appropriateness of IRT for measuring abilities and bipolar traits, such as pro versus contra attitudes. Surprisingly, if a diffusion model underlies the response processes, IRT models are appropriate for bipolar traits but not for ability tests. A reconsideration of the concept of ability that is appropriate for such situations leads to a new item response model for accuracy and speed based on the idea that ability has a natural zero point. The model implies fundamentally new ways to think about guessing, response speed, and person fit in IRT. We discuss the relation between this model and existing models as well as implications for psychology and psychometrics.},

They begin by analyzing 6 models of TAFC decision making and show that all but one can be reduced to the drift diffusion model, implementing the statistically optimal algorithm (most accurate for a given speed or fastest for a given accuracy). They prove further that there is always an optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy that maximizes various reward functions, including reward rate (percentage of correct responses per unit time), as well as several other objective functions, including ones weighted for accuracy. They use these findings to address empirical data and make novel predictions about performance under optimality.},

  abstract = {The SAT has long been a phenomenon of interest in behavioral science. From early on, the covariation between response speed and accuracy was seen not as a nuisance, but a signature of the decision process itself. Consequently, experimental investigations of SAT progressed largely in parallel with mathematical models of the decision process. This work is ongoing, but a consensus has emerged: agents make choices based on a sequential analysis of sensory evidence. As decades of research make clear, this decision process is adaptable: actions are dictated not only by the nature of perceptual input but also environmental constraints, internal goals, and biases. An embodiment of this flexibility, the SAT arises due to the inherent contradiction between response speed and decision accuracy. Faster responses entail less accumulated evidence, and hence less informed decisions. Sequential sampling models provide an intuitive framework for understanding SAT. Observers set a decision criterion—an amount of evidence required to commit to a choice—based on current task demands and internal goals. This begs the question: how can we know what decision criteria subjects employ? It would seem that without this knowledge, mean RTs and accuracy rates conflate experimental factors with strategic effects employed by the observer. The solution to this problem is to bring decision criterion6 under experimenter control. As explained below, this not only avoids ambiguity, but also quantifies precisely how accuracy trades off with latency.},

The model generates several novel insights into the nature of altruism. It explains when and why generous choices are slower or faster than selfish choices, and why they produce greater response in TPJ and vmPFC, without invoking competition between automatic and deliberative processes or reward value for generosity. It also predicts that when one’s own payoffs are valued more than others’, some generous acts may reflect mistakes rather than genuinely pro-social preferences.},

Diffusion model parameters were obtained from the fits to data from 2 experiments and consistency of parameter values, individual differences, and practice effects were examined using different numbers of observations from each subject. Two issues were examined—first, what sizes of differences between groups can be obtained to distinguish between groups, and second, what sizes of differences would be needed to find individual subjects that had a deficit relative to a control group. The parameter values from the experiments provided ranges that were used in a simulation study to examine recovery of individual differences. This study used several diffusion model fitting programs, fitting methods, and published packages. In a second simulation study, 64 sets of simulated data from each of 48 sets of parameter values (spanning the range of typical values obtained from fits to data) were fit with the different methods, and biases and standard deviations in recovered model parameters were compared across methods. Finally, in a third simulation study, a comparison between a standard chi-square method and a hierarchical Bayesian method was performed. The results from these studies can be used as a starting point for selecting fitting methods, and as a basis for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of using diffusion model analyses to examine individual differences in clinical, neuropsychological, and educational testing.},
