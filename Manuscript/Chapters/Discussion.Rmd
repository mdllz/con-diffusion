  In this paper, we aimed to study the cognitive basis of how people decide whether an idea is creative or not during divergent thinking. Divergent thinking is a two-phase process where people come up with ideas (ideation phase) and decide whether or not to use them [evaluation phase;  @Basadur:1995; @Guilford:1967; @RuncoBasadur:1993]. We focused on the evaluation phase and used Bayesian cognitive modeling to better understand it. Using a novel application of the drift diffusion model (DDM) we aimed to understand how people weigh the two components of creativity, originality and utility, when deciding whether an idea is creative or not. We used the Creative or Not (CON) task, a timed two-choice decision-making task, where people are presented with ideas of how to use an everyday object (e.g., use a book as a roof tile) and then decide whether these are creative or not. The DDM drift rate parameter represents people’s tendency to respond “creative” or “not creative” based on their judgements and response times. The CON-task stimuli varied on how original and how useful they were (e.g., using a book to read is useful, but not original, whereas using a book as roof tile can be both). This way we could estimate individual differences in how originality and utility implicitly contributed to people’s creativity judgements. Our main findings were: (1) stimulus originality strongly influenced participants’ decisions, whereas stimulus utility was only somewhat related to their tendency towards creative responses; (2) there were large individual differences in how much participants took the originality and utility of presented ideas into account; (3) participants’ implicit values of originality and utility on the CON-task were aligned with their self-reported importance ratings of originality and utility for creativity; (4) Alternative Uses task (AUT) scores for originality and utility coincided with how much the originality and utility of the presented CON-task idea weighed in on their decisions. We now discuss each of these findings in more detail.  
  Our finding that people value originality when evaluating creativity, evidenced by a substantial overall effect of originality on DDM drift rates, are in line with previous studies showing that people associate originality more so than utility with creativity [e.g., @CaroffBesancon:2008; @DiedrichEtAl:2015; @RuncoCharles:1993]. In both studies, the utility of ideas was only somewhat related to participants' tendency towards creative responses. In earlier work we also see that utility, or one of its creative synonyms (e.g., appropriateness, value) is less valued when it comes to judging creativity [e.g., @DiedrichEtAl:2015]. Future work with the CON-task could include additional information about presented ideas, such as “surprise” [@Boden:2004] and “impact” [@SternbergLubart:1996], to examine how these components implicitly influence people’s creativity judgments.  
  Interestingly, just as researchers sometimes disagree on the definition of creativity [@Simonton:2018], the homogenous group of psychology students in our study also varied greatly in their conceptions of creativity. We found both quantitative and qualitative individual differences in how they valued originality and utility [@HaafRouder:2017; @HaafRouder:2018]. Originality was usually important, but a few people even seemed to regard original stimuli to be “not creative”. Regarding utility, there were large individual differences too. Some participants seemed to value utility, a few rated any useful idea as “not creative”, and some appeared to disregard it entirely. Future research should look to generalize these results to other populations or types of creativity judgments. For example, adolescents appear to place more value on originality and less on utility [@StevensonEtAl:2021], so there may be a developmental trend. Also, judging the creativity of AUT ideas is interesting as the task is used so often in psychological assessment. But, would utility be considered more valuable in real-world situations, e.g., judging the creativity of ideas to combat climate change?  
  After the CON-task, we asked participants to rate how important they thought originality and utility were for creativity. These self-reported relevance ratings more or less corresponded to their implicit values of originality and utility on the CON-task. So, the more important someone reported originality or utility was for creativity, the more they took it into account on the CON-task. So it appears that the CON-task provides an indirect way to tap into what people consider creative.
Similar to @CaroffBesancon:2008, our results also showed that the more participants took originality and utility into account on the CON-task, the more original and useful their responses to the AUT were. We cannot talk about causality, but it seems plausible that people’s implicit values of originality and utility influence what ideas they produce and how they evaluate and select ideas during divergent thinking, like on the AUT. 

## Methodological Implications  
  To our knowledge, this is the first time a mathematical model such as the DDM has been applied to the evaluation phase of divergent thinking. The DDM is generally applied to timed two-choice decision tasks where there is clearly a correct answer, such as lexical decision tasks [e.g., @WagenmakersEtAl:2008]. Therefore, applying the DDM to the CON-task, where there is no correct answer and we are basically assessing what factors influence people’s tendency to decide if an idea is creative, is novel. Applying the DDM generally worked well on both CON-task studies, as suggested by the good model fit. However, the drift rate seemed to be mainly driven by decisions rather than response times (RTs) and RTs did not vary much across stimulus originality and utility ratings. At best, there was a tendency for stimuli with higher originality and utility ratings to be answered more slowly. A possible explanation is that the effects of originality and utility on the drift rate (i.e., people's tendency towards deciding “creative”) were negatively correlated in both studies. This means that the more participants valued originality, the less they valued utility and vice versa. There appears to be a trade-off where people balance one dimension against the other when judging creativity. This may explain why stimuli with both higher originality and utility took a little longer to process.  
  However, the lack of influence of RTs begs the question of whether the DDM is not overly complex for CON-task data. For example, a hierarchical probit analysis[^r] of our data resulted in similar conclusions. It would be interesting to examine whether RT effects are more apparent if participants are given less time (e.g., 3s versus the 9s in this study); especially since in the real-world people sometimes need to make split-second choices about which idea to pursue. Also, instructions that emphasize speed could affect the evaluation process, just as those of quantity or quality affect the ideation phase of divergent thinking  [@Said-MetwalyEtAl:2020].  

## Conclusion
  This paper demonstrates a new approach to studying the evaluation process during divergent thinking. Our novel application of the drift diffusion model provides a mathematical method to study how people decide what’s creative. The results imply that it is important to take both originality and utility into account when examining how people judge creativity. Also, given how conceptions of creativity vary, our findings suggest that when assessing creativity using divergent thinking tasks like the AUT, managers or researchers should clarify what the rating criteria are to provide a fair playing field for all.
