 Creative ideas are essential for tackling today's problems, from personal obstacles, such as combining work and childcare during a pandemic lockdown, to societal challenges such as climate change [@HennesseyAmabile:2010]. It is no wonder that educators are increasingly including creativity in curricula and that managers consider creativity a key skill [@Casner-LottoBarrington:2006; @IBM:2010]. Divergent thinking tasks are often used to assess creative ability, the ability to produce original and useful ideas [@Barron:1955; @RuncoJaeger:2012; @Stein:1953]. Perhaps the most common divergent thinking measure is the alternative uses task [AUT; @Guilford:1967; @RuncoAcar:2012]. On the AUT, people are typically asked to come up with as many unusual uses as possible for a given object (e.g., “bath toy” for the object “brick”) within a certain time interval. When solving the AUT, two main processes occur: ideation and evaluation [@Guilford:1967; @RuncoAcar:2012; @Basadur:1995]. Ideation is the “brainstorm” phase where one comes up with ideas, and evaluation is the decision making phase where one judges which ideas are creative enough to pursue (or in the case of the AUT to list as a response). While most research has focused on ideation and how to improve it [e.g., @BenedekEtAl:2006; @ForthmannEtAl:2019a], how people evaluate and select ideas is less understood [@deBuisonjeEtAl:2017; @HermanReiter-Palmon:2011; @HunterEtAl:2006; @RietzschelEtAl:2010; @RuncoSmith:1992]. Yet, in the real world, it only takes one well-selected idea to solve a problem (e.g., the printing press reduced the cost and labor of printing books, thereby increasing literacy and making knowledge more accessible) or disregarding a good idea to lose the battle in innovative business [e.g., Blockbuster vs. Netflix; @Randolph:2019]. In this paper, we take a cognitive modeling approach to fill this gap and study how people decide which ideas are creative or not on the AUT.  
  While the standard definition of creativity states that originality and utility are both needed for creativity, individuals may differ in how much they value these two dimensions. Previous research has mainly focused on population-level effects and found that people tend to value originality more than utility when judging the creativity of an idea [@CaroffBesancon:2008; @DiedrichEtAl:2015; @RuncoCharles:1993]. However, creativity is a much-used word and frequently discussed by laypeople [@MuellerEtAl:2018]. Consequently, different people may have substantially different conceptions of the importance of originality and utility for creativity [e.g., @LoewensteinMueller:2016]. For example, some may value utility more than others when judging creativity, and some may even find ideas or products that are not useful more creative [see @HaafRouder:2017; @HaafRouder:2018].  
  In order to examine the evaluation phase of the AUT and to explore individual differences in implicit conceptions of creativity, we apply the commonly used two-choice response time (RT) paradigm from the decision making literature [e.g., @KrypotosEtAl:2015; @Ratcliff:1978; @WagenmakersEtAl:2008], here in the form of the Creative-or-Not task [CON-task; @StevensonEtAl:2021]. Rather than deciding on the correct response [e.g., Is CFREE a word? Yes or No?; @MeyerSchvaneveldt:1971], on the CON-task people decide whether an AUT response is creative or not. For example, given the object “book” one must decide whether using it as a “roof tile” is creative (or not). The CON-task stimuli vary on the two dimensions of originality and utility, allowing us to unobtrusively assess individuals’ implicit values of originality and utility when judging creativity in the CON-task.  
  To gain insight into the cognitive basis of the evaluation process, we model CON-task data using the drift diffusion model [DDM; @Ratcliff:1978; @RatcliffMcKoon:2008; @WabersichVandekerckhove:2014]. Over time, the individual accrues more and more information to answer the posed question and then ultimately crosses a decision boundary, for example to decide that “No, CFREE is not a word.” or to say “Yes, roof tile is a creative use for a Book” (see Figure \@ref(fig:DDMfigure)). In the DDM the drift rate parameter reflects peoples’ tendency to respond “creative” or “not creative” based on their decisions as well as response times. By using the DDM to study creativity evaluation, we hope to disentangle otherwise potentially confounded, cognitive processes assumed to take place during the CON-task and to explore the role of response times. The originality and utility of the CON-task stimuli may not only influence decision outcomes, but also decision speed. For example, a highly original use may be easier to judge regarding creativity than a less original one and therefore generally be evaluated faster.

As a plausibility check for our cognitive modeling approach, we also examine how well the relationship between individuals’ implicit values and their explicit opinions about the relevance of the two dimensions for creativity are aligned. Furthermore, we investigate whether those who value originality and utility also tend to produce more original and useful AUT responses, respectively. Regarding the latter, we build on @CaroffBesancon:2008's study who found a positive relationship for originality and called for research examining the same for “appropriateness” (i.e., a term often used as synonym for the utility dimension).  
  To this end, we conducted two studies. Study 1 is exploratory where we initially fit the DDM model. In Study 2 we validate our pre-registered model from Study 1 and test specific hypotheses based on Study 1’s results.
