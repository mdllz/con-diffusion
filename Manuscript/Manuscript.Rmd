abstract: |
  When producing creative ideas (i.e., ideas that are original and useful) two main processes occur: ideation, where people brainstorm ideas, and evaluation, where they decide if the ideas are creative or not. While much is known about the ideation phase, the cognitive processes involved in creativity evaluation are largely unclear. In this paper, we present a novel modeling approach for the evaluation phase of creativity. We apply the drift diffusion model (DDM) to the creative-or-not (CON)-task to study the cognitive basis of evaluation and to examine individual differences in the extent to which people take originality and utility into account when evaluating creative ideas. The CON-task is a timed decision-making task where participants indicate whether they find uses for certain objects creative or not (e.g., using a book as a buoy). The different use items vary on the two creativity dimensions ‘originality’ and ‘utility’. In two studies (*n* = 293, 17806 trials; *n* = 152, 9291 trials), we found that stimulus originality was strongly related to participants’ drift rate, whereas stimulus utility was only somewhat associated with the drift rate. However, participants differed substantially in the effects of originality and utility. Furthermore, the implicit weights assigned to originality and utility on the CON-task were aligned with self-reported importance ratings of originality and utility and associated with divergent thinking performance. Our findings underline the importance of communicating rating criteria in divergent thinking tasks such as the alternative uses task to ensure a fair assessment of creative ability.
